# RFHash

A Ruby CLI tool for generating and comparing the hashes of files. This tool, much like my other Ruby CLI tools is written in the latest verison of [Ruby]() ( > 3.4.2) and uses only what Ruby itself includes in a standard installation.

**Supported Hashes:**
 - MD5
 - SHA-1
 - SHA-224
 - SHA-256
 - SHA-384
 - SHA-512
 - CRC32
 - CRC64
